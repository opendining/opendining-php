Open Dining PHP Helper Library
==============================
A library to simplify access to the Open Dining Network API.  See the [Open Dining developers' section] [1] for more information.

Usage
-----
Just include opendining.php in your PHP files, and you're ready to go.  See the examples in example.php for more info on setting up the REST client and making calls.

In the future, we will add specialized client methods for tasks like getting restaurant info, menus, and searches.
